/**
 * Phantom reference objects, which are enqueued after the collector
 * determines that their referents may otherwise be reclaimed.  Phantom
 * references are most often used for scheduling pre-mortem cleanup actions in
 * a more flexible way than is possible with the Java finalization mechanism.
 *
 * <p> If the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time that the
 * referent of a phantom reference is <a
 * href="package-summary.html#reachability">phantom reachable</a>, then at that
 * time or at some later time it will enqueue the reference.
 *
 * <p> In order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of
 * a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The <code>get</code> method of a
 * phantom reference always returns <code>null</code>.
 *
 * <p> Unlike soft and weak references, phantom references are not
 * automatically cleared by the garbage collector as they are enqueued.  An
 * object that is reachable via phantom references will remain so until all
 * such references are cleared or themselves become unreachable.
